Harbor-setupwrapper is a mechanism to deploy [VMware Harbor](https://github.com/vmware/harbor).

It "dockerizes" the [original setup process](https://github.com/vmware/harbor/blob/master/docs/installation_guide.md) by allowing a user to immediately bring up (with Docker Compose) Harbor without going through all the steps of the setup process as described [here](https://github.com/vmware/harbor/blob/master/docs/installation_guide.md). It works by setting shell environment variables instead of having to edit the `harbor.cfg` file. The environment variables are passed onto the harbor-setupwrapper container which goes through the preparation process.
